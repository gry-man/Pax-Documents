## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Pax Astralis Central Command! As a community administrator, also known as a member of Central Command, your role is crucial in maintaining a positive and immersive gaming environment for our players. This handbook provides guidelines and procedures to help you effectively fulfill your responsibilities.

## 2. Handling aHelps

### 2.1 Responding to aHelps

When responding to aHelps, it is important to maintain a professional and helpful demeanor. Start your response by addressing the player username and later mention it second time. For example: 1) Hello Username, how can I help you? 2) Exactly, Username. Just a moment please. 3) Do you need any additional help Username?


### 2.2 Avoiding Direct Intervention

Whenever possible, refrain from intervening directly in the game. Instead, encourage players to handle in-game situations in-character. This helps maintain the immersive experience for all players. Direct PMing should be minimized to avoid disrupting gameplay immersion.

## 3. Quality Assurance Management

### 3.1 Scoring System

To ensure consistent and high-quality support, administrators will be evaluated using a detailed scoring system:

- **Mentioning Player's Username (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores for properly mentioning the player's username twice during an aHelp session.
  
- **Asking if Additional Assistance is Needed (1 score):** Assign 1 score for asking if the player requires further assistance.

- **Empathy and Understanding (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores based on the administrator's demonstrated empathy and understanding of the aHelper's situation.

- **Remaining Polite and Keeping Cool (Additional scores during confrontation):** Extra scores can be given if the administrator maintains a calm and polite demeanor during tough aHelp situations, especially when confronted by the player.

- **Knowledge, Research, and Technical Help (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores for demonstrating knowledge, conducting research, and providing technical assistance during aHelp sessions.

- **Correct Answer (2 scores):** Assign 2 scores for providing the correct answer to the aHelp inquiry.

- **Good Closure of aHelp (1 score):** Assign 1 score for effectively closing the aHelp session on a positive note.

Admins are encouraged to learn and improve from these scores to provide better assistance in the future.

## 4. In-Character Approach and Delegating Enforcement

Maintaining an in-character approach is vital for preserving the immersive atmosphere of Pax Astralis. Address issues and conflicts in-character rather than resorting to out-of-character interventions. For minor offences such as rule violations 2, 5, and 6, delegate enforcement to Low Command as much as possible. These offences can often be handled entirely in-character, and Low Command serves as Central Command's assistant in promoting an in-character resolution approach.

## 5. Dealing with Self-Antagging

In the event of self-antagging, follow the established in-character retaliation procedure:

1. **Send a CentComm Spec Ops Team:** Coordinate with other administrators or event coordinators to dispatch a CentComm Spec Ops team to confront the self-antagger. If there are no ghosts available, you can be a lone NT operative to hunt the self-antagger.

2. **Bluespace Artillery Ship:** Initiate the call for a Bluespace Artillery Ship. This process takes 35 minutes, providing ample time for the in-game scenario to unfold naturally. Once the ship arrives, the self-antagger can be hit by bluespace artillery missile which kills them immediately. 

3. **Support the Death Squad:** The Bluespace Artillery Ship can also be utilized to support the CentComm Spec Ops team. Ensure that the response is proportional and aligned with the storyline.

Self-antagging, if it happens in a single case and does not include mass RDM, does not need to be documented. Please see below procedure for handling more extreme offences.

## 6. Dealing with Extreme Offences

In cases of extreme offences such as mass RDM, mass sabotage, exploiting, or ERP, follow these procedures:

- **Mass RDM and Mass Sabotage:**
  1. 3-day ban
  2. 7-day ban
  3. 14-day ban
  4. Permanent ban

- **Exploiting and ERP:**
  - Permanent ban, as these offences are considered severe and always warrant a permanent ban.

These are always documented with the noting system. 

By adhering to these guidelines, you contribute to the overall success of Pax Astralis and help create a vibrant and enjoyable gaming environment. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to Central Command!
