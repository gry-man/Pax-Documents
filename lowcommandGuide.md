## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to Pax Astralis Low Command! As a member of the Low Command team, you play a crucial role in maintaining order and ensuring the smooth operation of the space station.

 How is Low Command defined?

Low Command - Trusted regular players, who have been granted slightly elevated access compared to normal players. Access to Sector Administrator whitelist, and additional features on Discord and in-game. Their job is to mentor and be a welcoming/positive influence to any new players or learning players and work with central command from time to time. Low Command is handpicked or applied to after 1 month of stay in the Discord server.

As a low command member, you will be tasked with the role of a Sector Administrator or a Sector Commander (Whenever you choose to partake in one of these roles) and you will be in-charge of the entire sector, distributing payment amongst the employees, and making crucial IC decisions.

You will also act as a mentor for new players and those who want to learn more. Being Low Command lets you progress to become a Central Command member.

## Getting Started <a name="relation-cc"></a>

Low Command's relation to Central Command

Low Command is an administrative role, that handles the IC side of managing shifts and enforcing rules. While not classified as staff, it is something between a regular player and a moderator. 

Your status as a Low Command member only needs to be respected when you play as Sector Administrator or Sector Commander. When you choose to play other roles, you will be classified as a regular player and cannot preform LC actions, Additionally Rule 2 of escaping punishment also applies to escaping from an LC member trying to handle aHelp.

Example of escaping: LC member (Sector Admin/Commander) has reached the person to interact/talk with them, and then they go complete self-antag or prevent the situation from being investigated by other means.

## Rule Enforcement <a name="rule-enforcement"></a>

Rules 1, 2, 5, and 6 enforceable by LC. Rules 3, 4, 8, and up are handled by CC.

Counter-self antag procedure:

If there is one count of RDM / self antagonism you may permanently brig the offender and add (at minimum 100k) bail at your discretion.

If they are difficult to capture you can ask CentComm to send special ops to kill the user whom is in violation of the self-antag guideline. More information about the retaliation procedure is in the CentComm handbook.

If it escalates further into mass RDM (2 or more random murders) then CentCommâ€™s extreme offenses ban table is invoked and they may be banned at CentComm's discretion. This is mentioned in the CentComm handbook. 

### Language Enforcement

By Executive Order #1 issued by Central Command in Space Law, it is imperative to enforce the use of the English language in all general communications. If Non-English or cipher language-speaking individuals are detected in general comms they must be immediately detained and transported to the Pax Security Station for further investigation. Upon arrival, individuals will undergo testing for English proficiency. Those who demonstrate sufficient proficiency may be released back into the public domain, while others will face a permanent brig sentence as outlined in the executive order.
