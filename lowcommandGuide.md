## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to Pax Astralis Low Command! As a member of the Low Command team, you play a crucial role in maintaining order and ensuring the smooth operation of the space station.

 How is Low Command defined?

Low Command - Trusted regular players, who have slightly elevated access compared to normal players. Access to Sector Administrator whitelist, and some features on discord and in-game. Their job is to mentor and be welcoming/positive influence to any new players or learning players, and work with central command from time to time. Low Command is handpicked or applied to after 1 month of stay in Discord server.

As a low command member, you will be tasked with the role of Sector Administrator and Sector Commander (when ever you want to play as that) and you will be in charge of the entire sector, pay the employees and make crucial IC decisions.

You will also act as mentor for new players and those who want to learn more. Being Low Command lets you progress to become a Central Command member.

## Getting Started <a name="relation-cc"></a>

Low Command's relation to Central Command

Low Command is an administrative role, that handles the IC side of managing shift and enforcing rules. While not classified as staff, it is something between a regular player and moderator. 

Your status as Low Command member only needs to be respected when you play as Sector Administrator or Sector Commander. When you play other roles, yuo will be classified as regular player and can't do LC actions Rule 2 of escaping punishment also applies to escaping from LC member trying to handle aHelp.

Example of escaping: LC member (Sector Admin/Commander) has reached the person to interact/talk with them, and then they go complete self-antag or prevent the situation from being investigated by other means.

## Rule Enforcement <a name="rule-enforcement"></a>

Rules 1, 2, 5 and 6 enforceable by LC. Rules 3, 4, 8 and up handled by CC.

Counter-self antag procedure:

If there is one count of RDM / self antagonism you may permanently brig the offender and add (at minimum 100k) bail on your discretion.

If they are difficult to capture you can ask CentComm to send special ops to kill the self-antager. More information about the retaliation procedure in CentComm handbook.

If it escalates further in to mass RDM (2 or more random murders) then CentCommâ€™s extreme offences ban table is activated and they may be banned on CentComm discretion. This is mentioned in CentComm handbook. 

### Language Enforcement

In accordance with Executive Order #1 issued by Central Command in Space Law, it is imperative to enforce the use of English language in all general communications. Non-English or cipher language speaking individuals detected in general comms must be immediately detained and transported to Pax Security Station for further investigation. Upon arrival, individuals will undergo testing for English proficiency. Those who demonstrate sufficient proficiency may be released back into the public domain, while others will face a permanent brig sentence as outlined in the executive order.
